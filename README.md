# Text Unwrapper

> Stop manually deleting line breaks. Instantly transform messy multi-line text into clean, formatted paragraphs.

You copy text from a PDF. It comes out broken across a dozen lines. You copy from an email. Random line breaks everywhere. You manually delete each one. It takes forever. Text Unwrapper fixes this.
